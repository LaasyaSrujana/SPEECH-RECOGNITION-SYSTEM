DOMAIN: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

*DESCRIPTION OF SPEECH-RECOGNITION SYSTEM*:

This project is a Speech Recognition System that converts spoken audio into written text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques. It is designed to demonstrate how voice input can be processed, transcribed, and displayed in real time through a simple web interface.

🛠️ What I Worked On
I developed a complete speech-to-text application that listens to voice input from a microphone and converts it into text on the screen. The system uses a pre-trained speech recognition model, integrated into a user-friendly web interface. The project showcases how machine learning and real-time audio processing can be combined to make hands-free, accessible tools.

💻 Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

speech_recognition: For converting speech to text using Google's Web Speech API.

gradio: To build an interactive web interface with live microphone input.

pyaudio or microphone (handled by Gradio internally or optionally installed for local use)

Environment: Google Colab / Local Python Environment

Model Type: Pre-trained API-based ASR (no custom model training)

📌 Key Features
Microphone Input: Captures live audio through the browser.

Speech-to-Text Conversion: Uses Google’s speech recognition service for accurate transcription.

Real-Time Output: Displays recognized text immediately after speaking.

Gradio Interface: Easy-to-use front end for seamless voice interaction.

🌐 How to Use
Click the microphone button in the web interface.

Speak clearly into your device's mic.

The transcribed text will appear on the screen automatically.

📦 Resources Required
Internet access (to use Google’s Speech Recognition API)

Python libraries: speech_recognition, gradio

Optional: pyaudio (if using local microphone input directly in Python)

✅ Outcome
This project highlights the power of modern speech technologies to improve accessibility, productivity, and human-computer interaction. It can be applied in voice assistants, dictation tools, or accessibility software for users with limited mobility. The system is simple, effective, and demonstrates real-time speech processing in action.
